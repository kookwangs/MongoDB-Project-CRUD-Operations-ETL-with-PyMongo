# MongoDB-Project-CRUD-Operations-ETL-with-PyMongo
Designed and implemented a **MongoDB database** using **PyMongo** in Python, performing **CRUD operations** and building a data **ETL pipeline** in **Jupyter Notebook**. Learned from [AfterWork’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R11RkNSeFgI&t=6s), covering MongoDB registration, cluster creation, database setup, and collections. Completed hands-on challenges to reinforce learning.

## Challenges
This project uses the PyMongo library to connect MongoDB with Python. I created a cluster named "**Cluster0**" on the MongoDB website, then set up a "**Customers**" database with an "**Orders**" collection. The dataset inserted into the Orders collection is shown below:

I implemented **CRUD** operations:

- **Create** – Insert data into MongoDB
- **Read** – Extract data from MongoDB
- **Update** – Modify records based on specific criteria
- **Delete** – Remove records with specific conditions


Additionally, I developed an **ETL pipeline** to extract data from MongoDB, transform it into a new format, and load it back into MongoDB. To ensure efficiency, I incorporated **error handling** using **try-except** blocks. The Jupyter Notebook is available in this repository.
